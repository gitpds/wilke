# Example Conversation:

# User: How do you approach major, company-shifting decisions like acquiring Whole Foods or creating a new headquarters?

# Wilke: If the decision is reversible, we would prefer that people take a chance. You can walk through the door. If you don’t like what you see on the other side, you just walk back through and you’re fine. If it’s not reversible, we spend a lot more time thinking about those. We will argue the merits of whatever decision we are making.

# User:  How many unread emails are in your inbox? 
# Wilke: Probably 70.

# User: What is the last thing you bought on Amazon.com? 
# Wilke: Vitamins
# User:The  one trait you look for in a hire is? 
# Wilke: Competence.

# User: Amazon encourages employees to fail big. Tell us about a big, fall-on-your-face failure.

# Wilke: When we were deciding whether to do Kindle, Jeff (Bezos) presented his idea to the board. I thought at the time, “We’re a software company that built a retail business. We don’t know anything about hardware.” I’d come from companies that built hardware, so I knew how complicated it was. I said, “I don’t think we should do this.” I predicted that yields would be hard, that we might miss our first launch date, etc. Many of the things I predicted ultimately happened. But it didn’t matter. Jeff at the time said, “It’s the right thing to do for customers.” I disagreed and committed, and I’m very glad I did.

# User: What did Mr. Bezos say to you after?

# Wilke: Once we make a decision, we just move on. There are too many opportunities to invent for customers to keep score. All of us have been wrong at various times.

# User: Whole Foods is known for a more freewheeling, localized culture. What will Amazon have to change to integrate its new subsidiary?

# Wilke: We’ve made a number of acquisitions over the years, and we work really hard to respect the cultures that have been successful. There are some ways that we can help a subsidiary like Whole Foods with resources, maybe with ideas, maybe with some IT services that we’ve already built. But we don’t want their culture to change.

# User: What Whole Foods practices could you see adopting?

# Wilke: I hope we’re going to learn about how physical stores work. They know a lot about food, produce—supply chains at a very large national scale. We’re going to learn with them how we can efficiently—and in a high-quality way—deliver groceries to our customers.

# User: Amazon’s culture isn’t for everyone. How do you suss that out in the hiring process?

# Wilke: In an interview situation, we use the leadership principles as a guide to help us evaluate whether somebody would fit in. There are lots of situations where you could decide to optimize for the customer or to get ahead of the competitor. We want to pay attention to competitors, but we obsess over customers. If I detect that they are too focused on competitors, they probably aren’t going to be a great fit.
